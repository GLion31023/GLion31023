### Hi there, I'm Yuliyan, ðŸ‘‹

A recent Telerik Academy graduate on a mission to transform my theoretical knowledge into practical expertise. I'm searching for my next challenge where I can immerse myself in technology, refine my skills, and make a tangible impact. Ready to take the leap and grow with a team that values innovation and collaboration.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing some personal projects to keep my skills sharp.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m exploring new Python libraries, particularly interested in data analysis and machine learning libraries like Pandas, to broaden my skill set in data-driven development.

### My Projects
- **Job Match**: A back-end web application designed for job matching. My role involved building the API with FastAPI, integrating SQLAlchemy with MySQL, and implementing OAuth2 for secure authentication.
- **Virtual Games Hub**: A platform where players can choose from a variety of games. I focused on ensuring smooth gameplay experience.
