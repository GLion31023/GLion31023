### Hi there, I'm Yuliyan, ðŸ‘‹

A recent Telerik Academy graduate on a mission to transform my theoretical knowledge into practical expertise. I'm searching for my next challenge where I can immerse myself in technology, refine my skills, and make a tangible impact. Ready to take the leap and grow with a team that values innovation and collaboration.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing personal projects to keep my skills sharp and exploring new Python libraries.
- ðŸŒ± In addition to project work, I'm actively solving LeetCode problems to improve my problem-solving abilities and deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

### My Projects
- **Job Match**: A secure back-end web application designed for job matching. My work on this project included building the API with FastAPI, integrating SQLAlchemy with MySQL, and utilizing JWTs and OAuth2 for secure authentication and session management. Achieving 100% test coverage was a key milestone, along with implementing a tool to detect explicit content, enhancing platform integrity and user safety.
- **Currency Converter CLI**: A command-line interface application that provides real-time and historical currency conversion using the FastForex API. It supports conversions between a wide range of currencies, allowing users to fetch historical data up to 14 days from the current date under the constraints of a trial API key.
- **Personal Project Space**: A collection of diverse projects.
  - **Virtual Games Hub**: Play games like Hangman, where you test your vocabulary to guess hidden words, and Craps, a dice game where luck and strategy meet, all through command-line commands.
  - **Task-Board Project**: Manage tasks and issues efficiently. Add tasks, log activities, track changes with statuses, assign tasks to users, and more.
  - **Educational Worm**: Practice file manipulation and script self-replication, offering a glimpse into cybersecurity.
- **LeetCode**: Solving a variety of LeetCode problems to improve problem-solving skills and deepen understanding of data structures and algorithms. Current focus areas include Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers, Stack, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Linked List, and Trees.
- **Poker Decision Support System**: A pre-flop range decision support system designed to help poker players make optimal decisions based on GTO (game theory optimization). (Coming Soon)
