### Hi there, I'm Yuliyan, 👋
a recent Telerik Academy graduate on a mission to transform my theoretical knowledge into practical expertise.
I'm searching for my next challenge where I can immerse myself in technology, refine my skills, and make a tangible impact.
Ready to take the leap and grow with a team that values innovation and collaboration.
